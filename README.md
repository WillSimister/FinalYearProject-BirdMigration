# FinalYearProject-BirdMigration

To compile the main application, run the .sln file from any C# compiler. 
In the main file to run Python Scripts, you must set the directory to where they are stored.

In order to run the Python Scripts - you must have the following:

 - Get the Python and SciPy platform installed on your system if it is not already.
 - Install SciPy Libraries: 
 - There are 5 key libraries that you will need to install.
 - scipy
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
 - sklearn
 
 You may want to look into creating an Anaconda enviroment to seperate your machine learning environment from your personal computer.
 
 A folder called sample data is included alongside the project. 
 To use it correctly create an Agent that Breeds in canada and Nests in Argentina (Modelled against the American Golden Plover)
 Create an Environment where the following: 
 Northern Country is Canada and its closest countries are: N-Russia, E-Portugal, S-United States, W-Japan
 Southern Country is Argentina and its closest countries are: N-Paraguay, E-Uruguay, S-Uruguay, W-Chile
 
 Then you can upload the years data for each country for all 25 years.
 
 Then the application will be ready to run experiments and extrapolate data.
